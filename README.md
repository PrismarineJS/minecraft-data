## Wrappers

Minecraft-data is language independent, you can use it with these language specific modules :

| Wrapper name | Language | Data provided |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [node-minecraft-data](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-data) | Node.js | everything |
| [python-minecraft-data](https://github.com/SpockBotMC/python-minecraft-data) | python | everything |
| [McData](https://github.com/McEx/McData) | Elixir | protocol |

| [hs-minecraft-protocol](https://github.com/oldmanmike/hs-minecraft-protocol) | haskell | protocol.json haskell compiler |

If you want to use minecraft-data in a new language, we advise you to [create a new wrapper](doc/make-a-new-wrapper.md)

## Data quality

Minecraft data provides scripts to audit the data, they can be useful to check the data is correct :

 * [audit_blocks](tools/js/test/audit_blocks.js)
 * [audit_items](tools/js/test/audit_items.js)
 * [audit_recipes](tools/js/test/audit_recipes.js)

Minecraft data also provides json schemas in enums_schemas/ that are used in
test/test.js to check the json file are valid relative to these schemas.
These schemas can also be used to understand better how the json files are
formatted in order to use it.

## License

MIT

Some of the data was extracted manually or automatically from wiki.vg and minecraft.gamepedia.com.
If required by one of the sources the license might change to something more appropriate.

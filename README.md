## Data quality

Minecraft data provides scripts to audit the data, they can be useful to check the data is correct :

 * [audit_blocks](tools/js/test/audit_blocks.js)
 * [audit_items](tools/js/test/audit_items.js)
 * [audit_recipes](tools/js/test/audit_recipes.js)
 * [audit_shapes](tools/js/test/audit_shapes.js)

Minecraft data also provides json schemas in enums_schemas/ that are used in
test/test.js to check the json file are valid relative to these schemas.
These schemas can also be used to understand better how the json files are
formatted in order to use it.

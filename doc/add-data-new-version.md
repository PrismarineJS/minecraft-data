## Map icons
Icons can be found in the Minecraft jar file where they are added as a single sprite. 

The file location is `/assets/minecraft/textures/map/map_icons.png`.

Alternatively you might be able to look up the icons from the following page on the [Minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Map#Map_icons) or from [wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Map_Data).

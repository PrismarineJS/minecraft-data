<!--
  Proposing a new rule or a rule change? Please open an issue here first:
  https://github.com/standard/standard/issues
  
  If the rule has been accepted and you want to send a PR, please send it
  to: https://github.com/standard/standard. Add the rule to the
  'eslintrc.json' file, in the "rules" field. This is where rules live
  until a new major version of standard is released, at which point all
  new rules and rule changes are moved into eslint-config-standard.
